# Song-Popularity-Prediction-and-Content-Based-Recommendation-System
This project aims to build a recommendation system for songs based on the
analysis of audio features and song popularity. The project involves assessing the correlation
between audio features and song popularity, predicting a song's popularity score using its audio
feature attributes, classifying tracks into different genres based on their audio features, and
building a recommendation model based on the user's favorite song's features.
